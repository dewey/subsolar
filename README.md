# Sextual

Sextual is a Textual theme inspired heavily by Solarized (for color) and Sublime (for typography).

I made extensive use of [this Solarized cheat sheet](http://www.zovirl.com/2011/07/22/solarized_cheat_sheet/).

Because I'm on IRC all day every day, I decided it was worth investing a bit of time to try to make it look better. This is the best I can come up with so far, and I'll improve it over time and would appreciate your help. CSS is not my number one skill. :-)

## Usage

To use, first find where your Textual themes are located. This might work for you:

  $ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/Styles

Next, just clone this project right there:

  $ git clone git@github.com:shiflett/sextual.git

Restart Textual, then under Preferences, you should see a new style called sextual.

If you have any trouble, just let me know, and I'll try to help.
